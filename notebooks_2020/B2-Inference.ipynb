    "Again, we see that 14/52 died on the control whereas only 5/55 died on penicillin. That seems pretty good, but could this be the result of randomness? That is, could we have seen these results simply by chance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The chance mechanism at work here is **the randomization into penicillin or control**, something Hill advocated to prevent physician bias, and Fisher argued was the soul of the statistical enterprise. Randomization gives us a yardstick to measure the significance of an event against. \n",
    "\n",
    "Walking through our testing steps, we need a **null hypothesis** or \"straw man\". The one in play here is the assumption that both the control and penicillin are essential the same when it comes to treating TB. For example, the people who died on in the control group would have died if they received penicillin, and those who survived under penicillin would have also survived if they were simply given bedrest, the control.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Under the null hypothesis, each person's outcome, whether they lived or died, would have been the same no matter whether they received penicillin or bed rest. That's our straw man, our devil's advocate. \n",
    "\n",
    "So reasoning under the null, everything in that table was the result of randomization. You can imagine that Hill had a total of 107 people, 18 of whom were destined to die no matter what treatment he gave them. By pure luck, fewer people who ultimately died of TB landed in the penicillin group. We could then take as **our test statistic** the number of people who died in the penicillin group and ask how often does randomization produce a table where 4 people or fewer die while receiving penicillin? \n",
    "\n",
    "*If that is a pretty common occurrence*, then we would say that the data don't seem inconsistent with the null and we would think about what happened and whether penicillin is as beneficial as we thought. *If it is an uncommon occurrence*, we could take it as evidence that our null hypothesis is wrong, that the two treatments are not the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create our null distribution, let's try rerandomizing people into penicillin or bed rest, since under the null hypothesis no matter what treatment we gave them they would have lived or died just as they did in Hill's study.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we copy the data set `hill` and make a new, identical data frame (first cell). We then take the treatment column and replace it with a mixed up version of the original (second cell). That is, we put all the treatments in a hat (55 \"control\" and 57 \"penicillin\") and draw them out one at a time, assigning or reassigning them one-by-one to the patients. **Each of the 107 patients is re-randomized.** The defaults for `sample()` are to draw everything from the hat without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "And because the null hypothesis assumes these two treatments performing identically, the patients would have lived or died exactly as they did in Hill's table. Hence we have repeated his experiment with a different randomization. **So, let's look at some of the experiments that Hill didn't run, but are equally legit under the null.**\n",

    "So far we have played a little fast and loose with some of the technicalities and we can give you more resources on how testing works, but you get the spirit. In later incarnations, competing camps tried to firm up significance testing by casting it as a decision problem. Hypothesis testing was developed by Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson and involves not only a null hypothesis but also an alternative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neyman and Pearson talk specifically about errors you can make in this testing process (rejecting a true null hypothesis or failing to reject a false null hypothesis, say). By accounting for these two errors (called Type I and Type II), they provided tools for researchers to balance the kinds of mistakes they might make. But there's no new magic here - in fact Neyman and Pearson decided that these rules were important because in their estimation, you really couldn't learn anything from data. You could only behave in ways that protected you from making mistakes. It was a kind of behavioral induction.\n",

    "Next time, we will look at confidence intervals (margins of error), starting with [things like these](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/)."
