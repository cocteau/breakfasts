    "Introduction to R and the Jupyter notebook\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg\" width=75 style=\"float:left;margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;\"> We will be using the R language for statistical computing. It has a long history, at least in conception, dating back to the early 1970s. It was developed by statisticians to support \"exploratory data analysis,\" a process we will adapt to help us find stories in data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The practice involves repeated \"looks\" at a data set -- a \"look\" might be some graphical representation of the data like a plot, or the output of some form of computation like a numerical summary, a table, or a \"model\" fit. Statistians are exceptionally visual people, obsessed with \"seeing\" what the data have to offer, and \"views\" maybe provided through a variety of computational means. As a journalist, you might think of this attempt to \"see\" as a kind of interview process, with each subsequent look, a follow-up question. R is, by design, expressive in statistical computations and graphics, meaning it allows us to formulate and act on statistical ideas in an easy way. While we installed R via Anaconda and the Jupyter notebook, most of everyting you need to know about the language, it's uses and extensions, is available on the [R project website](http://r-project.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's probably worth spending a moment to review the techno-social history of R -- Where did it come from? Why was it invented? Who was behind it and what problems were they struggling with. We care about the origin story of our tools becauae that helps us be on guard for how our analyses are being shaped by the tool makers. Every tool or platform designer has a set of use cases in mind, and you are rewarded for behaving in ways that the designers anticipated. But this can have an affect on the stories that you are capable of finding or telling with data. (Don't get me started on spreadsheets!) Here are a few good resources reviewing where R came from.\n",
    "\n",
    ">[Roger Peng at Johns Hopkins has a Coursera course that starts with an R overview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming/lecture/pAbaE/overview-and-history-of-r)\n",

    "[John Chambers, the designer of a precurser to R called S talks about his motivations](https://web.archive.org/web/20150305201743/http://www.stat.bell-labs.com/S/history.html)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "[The R project website itself has a recounting of its history](https://www.r-project.org/about.html)\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "And it's worth seeing who is at the helm of R development these days. [Here's the R-core team from March of 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150305213410/https://www.r-project.org/foundation/members.html) and [here is the team today](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/members.html). Notice anyting?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook you've downloaded provides a very particular *interface* to the R language. (Jupyter actually gives you access to Julia, Python and R -- three languages which explain the name Ju-pyt-er.) You will type commands from the R language into the notebook's \"cells\" and execute them by typing \"shift-enter.\" These code cells are your place to author R, specifying manipulations of and orchestrating looks at your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the data, let's take a look at our environment. **The text you are reading is written in \"Markdown,\"** a kind of pre-language for creating HTML. You can double-click on this \"cell\" to see the raw Markdown, and then hold down the \"shift\" key and hit the \"enter\" key to render it as HTML. Notice that you can still recognize lists and emphasized text from the Markdown additions, and that's the other point of this. Your documents, while written in plain text, make use of typographical conventions that make the document's highlighting understandable even without translation to HTML. That's a good trick! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find [the Markdown description here.](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Take a moment and please go through the [Markdown Tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com) -- it will be time well spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A big calculator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's start looking at R. First, you can think of R as a big calculator (remember our friend Fisher said that he learned all he knew over his calculator) and its simplest commands are just arithmetic expressions. Add 2 and 3 below by clicking on the cell and then hit \"enter\" while holding down the shift key -- this sends the R expression \"2+3\" to be evaluated and the answer should be returned."

    "Much of statistics has to do with simple manipulations on tables. It's so important, in fact, that people have contributed tools that make these operations easy. We'll introduce them while looking at data and relating our computations to reported stories about crime. A tall order! \n",
    "\n",
    "As I said above, tools are added to R in the form of **packages**. A package is simply a bundle of code and data. Again, by authoring packages, people can contribute new functionality to the R language. In the case we will look at now, the package was written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), and, as we said, introduces new functions to make table manipulations a little simpler. The package is called **dplyr.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn about a package, we can read the documentation provided by its author. [Here is the documentation for dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html). It can be a little opaque. Sometimes, however, when people create a package in R, they also write a **vignette** that walks you through how to use the data and commands in the package. That is true for dplyr, and you can read the [vignette for dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) after we've run through this brief introduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of R as being driven by \"verbs\". We have seen `read.csv()` and `help()`, for example. In making his package, Hadley introduced new verbs into the language. We'll show how to use them in the examples below. In each case, **the functions take a table (a data frame) as input and return another, altered data frame as output.** These functions let you specify subsets, sort on columns, and create new columns. But in each case, you give a table and you get a table.\n",
